Following a youtube tutorial to make a Grid Based, City Building game to place Roads and Houses.
Youtube Tutorial Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5dYlaeriyo
This tutorial implements whole game in Unreal Blueprints, in contrast I have developed whole game in C++.
Got idea about what needs to be implemented, and I did the whole job in C++.
In this project, you can find how to make a Grid, spawn an actor and place it on a specific cell.
